Project 1: Tokenizer
====================
# Brief Overview:
This program is a tokenizer of inputted strings that also maintains a history
of those strings.
It includes a user interface with several options to explore its contents in
depth.
# How to run the program:
When in the source folder's directory, i.e. `projectOne/src` , type `make -k`
then press enter to compile the program.
Proceed by typing `./tokenizer` to run the program.
The user is *expected* to initially select option `0` followed by entering
words or gibberish then return to the menu and select either option `1` or `2`
to examine their input.
# Additional notes:
Entering **special characters** or other **unintended input** may not be
accounted for, thus will lead to unexpected results.
